# jpegRename
for Julie's spine number renaming

This will take files labeled [spine#]_BD.jpg  and rename them [aSKU].MAIN.jpg using the mapping in a provided .csv file.

I finished this program.  There are a bunch of spines that are associated with box sets.
The next improvement should be to create a text file to say what we messed up
